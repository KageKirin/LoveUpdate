h2. Notes

There are some restriction on your game if you want to use this tool:

  * You must host your game on GitHub.
  * You must use the UaLove back-end.

If you dislike these restrictions, you're free to create and distribute your own version of the tool.

h2. How to Use

  # "Download a zipball":http://github.com/TheLinx/LoveUpdate/zipball/master of the project.
  # Unzip the files somewhere.
  # Rename updconf.example.lua to updconf.lua and open it in a text editor.
  # Change the variables contained within to reflect your game (e.g. name = "TheLinx", repo = "LoveSpin")
  # In your repo, create a branch called "upd", and create manifests so it looks something like "this":http://github.com/TheLinx/LoveSpin/tree/upd
  # Zip up the directory. Make sure main.lua is in the top-level directory.
  # Rename the .zip to .love and distribute the .love file instead of a .love of your game.

Have fun!
